# NYU Clinical AI Workshop Website 

This repository contains code for the React App I developed to build a website for PI Farah Shamout's Clinical AI workshop. 

## Repository content 

- A public folder with 4 files to set up the webiste icon on the title bar. 
- A source folder that contains two folders:
  1. An asset folder with all media (pictures in our case) used in the website. 
  2. A components folder which contains 7 folders corresponding to the React components that we created. Each of these 7 folders contains a .js file and a .css file.
