# NYU Clinical AI Workshop Website 

This repository contains code for the React App I developed to build a website for PI Farah Shamout's Clinical AI workshop. 

## Repository content 

- A public folder with 3 to set up the webiste icon on the title bar and a index.html file which is the first page that is loaded when we run the ReactApp. 
- A source folder that contains:
  1. An asset folder with all media used in the website 
  2. A components folder which contains 7 folders corresponding to the React components that we created. Each of these 7 folders contains a .js file and a .css file 
  3. App.js file which is the main component in React and acts as a container for all other components
  4. index.js and index.css files which are the js and css files corresponding to the index.html file in the public folder.
- package.json file which has the list of node dependencies needed for the ReactApp
- package-lock.json file which keeps track of the exact dependency trees at any given time
